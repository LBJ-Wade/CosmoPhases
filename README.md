## Introduction
This Python code was written to answer the question whether the Higgs triplet model is a suitable Standard Model extension that can predict the baryonic asymmetry of the Universe. The effective potential is implemented in `potential.py`. Electroweak phase transitions are studied using `phase_transition.py`. A complete phase diagram was generated by scanning the free parameter space in `phase_diagram.py`. Finally, the bubbe wall velocity is computed in `bubble_wall_velocity.py`.

Further details can be found on [ArXiV](https://github.com/deniswerth/CosmoPhases).

## The Model
Add effective potential TeX file in repository and explain the main results.

## Usage
Short intro to explain what can be done with the code with some examples. Go through each file and explain their use with a few line of code.

### Effective potential in `potential.py`
(Say that CosmoTransitions has been changed to allow on-shell renormalization and factorial from scipy.special)

### Phase transition study in `phase_transition.py`
Study the phase transition for a given point in the parameter space.

### Phase diagram study in `phase_diagram.py`
Perform a scan.

### Bubble wall velocity in `bubble_wall_velocity.py`
