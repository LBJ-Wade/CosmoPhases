## Introduction
Some introduction

## The Model
Add effective potential TeX file in repository and explain the main results.

## Usage
Short intro to explain what can be done with the code with some examples. Go through each file and explain their use with a few line of code.

### Effective potential in `potential.py`
(Say that CosmoTransitions has been changed to allow on-shell renormalization and factorial from scipy.special)

### Phase transition study in `phase_transition.py`
Study the phase transition for a given point in the parameter space.

### Phase diagram study in `phase_diagram.py`
Perform a scan.
