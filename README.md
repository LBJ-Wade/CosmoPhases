## Introduction
This Python code was written to answer the question whether the Higgs triplet model is a suitable Standard Model extension that can predict the baryonic asymmetry of the Universe. The effective potential is implemented in `potential.py`. Electroweak phase transitions are studied using `phase_transition.py`. A complete phase diagram was generated by scanning the free parameter space in `phase_diagram.py`. Finally, the bubbe wall velocity is computed in `bubble_wall_velocity.py`. All codes are in the CosmoPhases file.

Further details including the model can be found on [ArXiV](https://github.com/deniswerth/CosmoPhases).

## Usage
Our model has three free parameters: mDelta (Higgs triplet mass), kappa (portal coupling constant), and LambdaDelta (triplet quartic coupling constant). Every code is written as a class with mDelta, kappa and LambdaDelta as inputs. In what follows, we go through each code and explain how one can use them with just a few lines of code.

### Effective potential in `potential.py`
In this code, the full effective potential (tree-level potential, Coleman-Weinberg potential using the on-shell renormalization scheme, one-loop thermal potential, thermal mass corrections) is implemented. The full effective potential can be imported in a seperate file with

```python
from potential import Finite_Temperature_Potential
mDelta, LambdaDelta, kappa = 700, 0.1, 10
FTP = Finite_Temperature_Potential(mDelta, LambdaDelta, kappa)
```
We note that CosmoTransitions has been changed to allow on-shell renormalization. The modified CosmoTransitions code can be found in the CosmoTransitions file.

### Phase transition study in `phase_transition.py`
Study the phase transition for a given point in the parameter space.

### Phase diagram study in `phase_diagram.py`
Perform a scan.

### Bubble wall velocity in `bubble_wall_velocity.py`
