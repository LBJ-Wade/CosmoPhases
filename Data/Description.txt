The scan was performed in two regions (II and III according to regions.pdf). 
The tree-level potential is shown in both regions : 
  -Tree_level_potential_II.pdf for (mDelta, kappa, LambdaDelta) = (400, 5.3, 0.1)
  -Tree_level_potential_III.pdf for (mDelta, kappa, LambdaDelta) = (600, 6, 0.1)

The points in region II are presented in the RegionII file with :
  -One-step first-order data (mDelta, kappa, History)
  -Two-step first-order data (mDelta, kappa, History)
  -Two-step second-order data (mDelta, kappa)


LambdaDelta      : 0.1
Distribution     : Evenly spaced points in parallelogram
History          : Each phase transition is an array with [Tcrit, high_vev, low_vev, transtype, Delta_rho]
